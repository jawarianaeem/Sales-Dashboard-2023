- **Product Sub-Category:** The sub-category to which the product belongs.
- **Order Date:** The date on which the sale occurred.
- **Profit/Loss:** A calculated field representing the profit or loss from sales, based on cost and price.

## Key Questions

1. In which month did the total sales, profit, and quantity sold peak in 2023?
2. What are the months with the lowest sales, profit, and quantity sold?
3. Which product sub-categories contributed the most to sales and profit?
4. What are the overall profit and loss trends over time?
5. How do sales and profit compare by product sub-category for the year 2023?

   - **Sales and Profit Over Time:** This graph shows how both sales and profit changed over the course of the year.
4. **Filters and Interaction:** The dashboard may include filters for time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to allow users to zoom into specific months or time frames for deeper analysis.
